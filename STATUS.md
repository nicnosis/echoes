# Echoes Development Status

**Last Updated:** January 16, 2025  
**Current Phase:** Core mechanics implementation with debug tooling

## ✅ Recently Completed Features

### Movement & Animation System (Jan 16)
- **Player movement animation**: Breathing effect during movement with smooth ramp up/down
- **Enemy breathing animation**: Sine wave scaling (±12%, 750ms period) for lifelike movement
- **Smart animation transitions**: Player animation smoothly returns to normal when stopping

### Debug UI System (Jan 16)
- **External debug panel**: Checkbox UI positioned top-left outside game canvas
- **Real-time toggle**: "Show Bounds" instantly hides/shows debug visualizations
- **Comprehensive debug rendering**: Player hitbox, enemy hitboxes, weapon ranges, pickup radius, body part nodes

### Stats & HP System Overhaul (Jan 16)
- **Fixed HP calculation order**: Stats recalculation now happens before HP setting
- **Separated concerns**: `recalculateStats()` vs `player.heal()` methods
- **Level up HP fix**: Both current HP and maxHP increment by 1 on level up
- **Clean initialization**: Verify parts → recalculate stats → heal to max

### Sprite Scaling System (Jan 16)
- **Flexible body part scaling**: Added `scale` column to bodyparts.csv before stats
- **Native resolution support**: Uses sprite.naturalWidth/Height * scale instead of fixed 30px
- **Semantic CSV access**: Uses `row['columnName']` instead of fragile array indices
- **Default torso switch**: Changed from oblong torso to turtle shell

### Wave Cleanup System (Jan 16)
- **Comprehensive cleanup()**: Resets player position, clears all game objects at wave end
- **SpawnManager cleanup**: Clears pre-spawn indicators and resets spawn state
- **Clean slate waves**: Every wave starts with completely reset state

### Spawn Feedback (Jan 16)
- **"Spawn Blocked" floating text**: Shows when player prevents enemy spawn by standing on indicator
- **Improved spawn system**: Better data flow from PreSpawnIndicator → SpawnManager → Game

## 🚧 Current Implementation Status

### Core Systems
- ✅ **Player movement & stats**: Complete with layered stat system
- ✅ **Enemy spawning**: SpawnManager with pre-spawn indicators working
- ✅ **Combat system**: Projectile-based weapons with damage calculation
- ✅ **Body parts system**: CSV-driven with stat bonuses and sprite scaling
- ✅ **Wave progression**: 21 waves planned, basic structure implemented
- ⚠️ **Transformation system**: Planned but not yet implemented

### UI Systems  
- ✅ **Debug UI**: External panel with bounds toggle
- ✅ **HUD**: Health display, wave info, basic stats
- ✅ **Pause/Shop**: HTML overlay system working
- 🚧 **Stats display**: Basic implementation, needs polish

### Visual Systems
- ✅ **Sprite scaling**: Flexible CSV-driven scaling
- ✅ **Movement animations**: Player and enemy breathing effects
- ✅ **Debug visualizations**: Comprehensive bounds/radius display
- 🚧 **Visual polish**: Functional but needs art pass

## 🐛 Known Issues
- None currently identified
- Debug system working well for identifying issues early

## 📋 Next Priorities

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Test sprite scaling system**: Verify all body parts render correctly at different scales
2. **Expand debug UI**: Add more debug options (spawn rates, stats display, etc.)
3. **Polish movement animations**: Fine-tune animation speeds and scales

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)  
1. **Implement transformation marketplace**: Convert shop to body part selection
2. **Add more body parts**: Expand beyond current frog head + turtle torso
3. **Visual polish pass**: Improve overall game aesthetics

### Medium Term (Next Month)
1. **Core transformation system**: Full chimera building mechanics
2. **Save/load system**: Persistent progress across sessions
3. **Audio integration**: Classical music adaptive system

## 🎯 Current Focus Areas
- **Sprite scaling refinement**: Getting all body parts to look good
- **Debug tooling expansion**: Building tools to make development easier  
- **System stability**: Ensuring all core mechanics work reliably

## 📊 Technical Health
- **Build status**: ✅ Working
- **Performance**: ✅ Smooth 60fps
- **Memory leaks**: ✅ None detected (cleanup system working)
- **Code quality**: ✅ Good separation of concerns established
