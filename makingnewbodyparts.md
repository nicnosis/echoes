I want you to use these to generate a bunch of gear.

Currently there are these body part types:
1 head
2 torso (think body)
3 legs
4 arms (these are weapons e.g. a lobster claw, eagle dagger, lion sword etc.)
5 accessories - on average will not have humongous stat bonuses unless they're rare etc like Baphomet Horns after killing the boss.
