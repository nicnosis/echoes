# Echoes

A transformation roguelike where you evolve as a chimera.

## What is this?

Fight through 21 waves as a hybrid creature, collecting body parts from defeated enemies. Each new part fundamentally changes who you are - not just your stats, but your identity.

**Core concept**: Personal transformation through adversity. Every body part acquisition represents meaningful change, not just power upgrades.

## How to play

- **WASD** to move
- **Escape** to pause
- Survive waves, level up, transform

## Tech stack

- TypeScript + HTML5 Canvas
- Tauri for desktop packaging
- Vite for building

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the game in your browser.

## Current status

**Working**: Basic combat, wave system, stats, body parts  
**Next**: Transformation marketplace, more creatures, visual polish
