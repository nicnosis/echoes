# Echoes Development Progress Aug 10 - Aug 16

## Major Features & Systems Implemented

### Camera & Rendering Overhaul
- Implemented camera system with 1.5x zoom for enhanced visual personality
- Upgraded canvas from 800x600 to 1200x900 resolution
- Rebuilt coordinate system using pure world coordinates with camera transforms
- Fixed rendering inconsistencies across all game entities

### Visual & Animation Systems
- Added breathing animation system for player and enemies with different parameters
- Implemented enemy death animations with fade and shrink effects
- Created damage flash overlay system with proper collision boundaries
- Enhanced sprite scaling system with CSV-driven configuration
- Added movement-based animation intensity for player character

### Enemy & Combat Systems
- Introduced crab enemy with AI pathfinding and sprite rendering
- Implemented comprehensive damage system with armor reduction and dodge mechanics
- Added critical hit system with visual feedback through floating text
- Created enemy spawn management with pre-spawn indicators and player blocking
- Enhanced collision detection with proper hitbox visualization

### Body Parts & Equipment
- Built modular body parts system with CSV data loading
- Implemented sprite flipping and positioning for different body parts
- Created flexible equipment stat integration with three-layer architecture
- Added turtle shell torso and frog head as default equipment

### Stats & Progression
- Redesigned stats system with clean base + levelUp + gear architecture
- Simplified HP calculation and healing mechanics
- Implemented XP gain system with automatic level progression
- Added stat bonus selection during level up phases
- Created comprehensive stat display for UI integration

### UI & Debug Tools
- Moved wave timer from canvas to HTML/CSS overlay
- Added external debug panel with real-time toggles
- Implemented bounds visualization for hitboxes and ranges
- Created floating text system for damage numbers and status messages
- Enhanced HUD system with proper stat integration

### Code Architecture & Documentation
- Consolidated all project documentation into comprehensive CLAUDE.md
- Established code organization standards with table of contents adherence
- Refactored renderer access patterns across all game entities
- Implemented clean separation between game logic and rendering
- Added development guidelines and best practices documentation

### Data Management
- Organized CSV configuration files into dedicated data directory
- Implemented semantic column access for maintainable data parsing
- Created body parts database with stat definitions and scaling
- Established data-driven approach for game balance and configuration

## Technical Improvements
- Fixed coordinate transformation bugs and rendering misalignments
- Eliminated flickering issues with floating text and alpha blending
- Optimized draw order for proper visual layering
- Improved breathing animation performance with cached calculations
- Enhanced collision detection accuracy with center-based logic
